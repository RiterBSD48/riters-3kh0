      <p>Hey everyone!<br>
        Welcome to v4.2.3!<br>
        Sorry for the lack of updates recently, I have been dealing with school and some other stuff.<br>
        This version has a lot to offer!<br>
        Most games should be fixed by now, I am still working on them to see which ones aren't.<br>
        Added a few reviews and games that people requested from Google Forms (thanks!)<br>
        I suggest you to join <a href="https://discord.gg/DtJZE3cgwj" target="_blank">our discord</a> to report any bugs or request any features there.<br>
        I have removed the old Google Forms since I am rarely actively checking requests there, sorry if it took some time to add yours!<br>
        GitHub issues will come soon, once I get everything working.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Thank you for everyone who forked our relived, assets repo and our 3kh0, relived repo!! I never expected this to blow up.</strong><br>
        <strong>If you have Discord, I recommend you joining <a href="https://discord.gg/DtJZE3cgwj" target="_blank">our server</a> to request any features/games or to report a bug since I am mostly active there.</strong><br>
        <strong>If you would like to make your own 3kh0, relived. website, you can check on <a href="https://github.com/whoisev/whoisev.github.io" target="_blank">our GitHub repo.</a></strong>
